description: Create and render videos programmatically with Remotion. Use when making videos, motion graphics,
or animated content.
Overview
Remotion is a React framework for creating real MP4 videos programmatically. Each frame is a React component
render — animations are driven by useCurrentFrame(), not CSS transitions.
Sandbox Setup
Bun is pre-installed. Create projects under /work/:
cd /work
bunx create-video@latest my-video --template blank
cd my-video
bun install
Use bun instead of npm for all package management, and bunx instead of npx for CLI commands:
bunx remotion add @remotion/transitions   # add packages
bunx remotion render MyVideo out/video.mp4 # render
bunx remotion ffmpeg -i input.mp4 out.mp3  # ffmpeg operations
Captions
When dealing with captions or subtitles, load the ./references/subtitles.md file for more information.
Using FFmpeg
For some video operations, such as trimming videos or detecting silence, FFmpeg should be used. Load the ./
references/ffmpeg.md file for more information.
Audio visualization
When needing to visualize audio (spectrum bars, waveforms, bass-reactive effects), load the ./references/audio-
visualization.md file for more information.
