description: Create, modify, and delete scheduled cron jobs. Use when scheduling recurring tasks on a cron.
Before any scheduled cron operation, always list existing cron jobs first.
List All Scheduled Crons
find /work/crons -name "task.json" -type f 2>/dev/null | while read f; do
  echo "=== $(dirname "$f" | sed 's|/work/crons/||') ==="
  jq -r '"title: \(.title // "untitled")\ncron: \(.cron)\ndesc: \(.description // "" | .
[0:100])...\ncreated: \(.created_at)\nupdated: \(.updated_at)"' "$f" 2>/dev/null || cat "$f"
  echo ""
done
And for relevant cron jobs also their task.json, LEARNINGS.md and execution.log.
Review this output before creating a new cron job to avoid duplicates or modifying the wrong one.

Creating an Agent Cron (runs AI agent with prompt)
Use create_agent_cron for tasks that need AI reasoning:
path: Cron path (e.g., /reports/weekly)
title: Short title
description: Instructions for the agent to execute on each run
cron: Cron expression (e.g., 0 9 * * 1-5)
slack_sender_name (optional): Custom Slack display name for messages from this cron (e.g., "Viktor
Reports")
model (optional): claude-opus-4-6#ReasoningLevel:very_high (default, recommended), gpt-5.4, 
claude-sonnet-4-6, or gemini-3-flash-preview
trigger_now: Set true for immediate execution
Model guidance:
Prefer claude-opus-4-6#ReasoningLevel:very_high for most agent crons.
Use gpt-5.4 when you want the strongest OpenAI model for complex professional work.
Use claude-sonnet-4-6 for lower-cost routine work.
Use gemini-3-flash-preview only for simple, high-volume tasks where quality trade-offs are acceptable.

from sdk.tools.scheduled_crons import create_agent_cron
await create_agent_cron(
    path="/reports/weekly",
    title="Weekly Report",
    description="Generate a weekly summary of team activity",
    cron="0 9 * * 1",  # Every Monday at 9am
    model="claude-opus-4-6#ReasoningLevel:very_high",
    slack_sender_name="Weekly Reports",
    trigger_now=False,
)
Creating a Script Cron (runs Python script directly)
Use create_script_cron for deterministic tasks that don't need AI:
path: Cron path (e.g., /cleanup/logs)
title: Short title
script_path: Path to Python script in sandbox (e.g., /work/scripts/cleanup_logs.py)
cron: Cron expression
trigger_now: Set true for immediate execution
from sdk.tools.scheduled_crons import create_script_cron
await create_script_cron(
    path="/cleanup/logs",
    title="Log Cleanup",
    script_path="/work/scripts/cleanup_logs.py",
    cron="0 0 * * *",  # Daily at midnight
    trigger_now=False,
)
Conditional Execution
Agent crons are expensive — each execution runs a full AI agent. Scheduling agent crons more than ~6 times per
day can get costly fast. Use condition_script_path whenever possible to skip unnecessary runs, or limit the
cron to work hours only (e.g. 0 9-17 * * 1-5). If neither is feasible, tell the user that the frequency could
become expensive and recommend a rarer schedule. Never increase the frequency of the heartbeat cron.
Both agent and script crons accept an optional condition_script_path. The scheduler runs this script before
each execution — exit 0 to run, non-zero to skip that cycle.
Use for: only run when new Slack messages appeared, business days only, Stripe revenue above a threshold, a file
was updated, etc.
You can write your own condition script, but you should always test it once before wiring it into a cron.
Condition script at /work/scripts/conditions/has_new_slack_messages.py:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
29
import sys
from sdk.utils.slack_reader import get_new_slack_messages
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
since = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(hours=1)
if not get_new_slack_messages(since=since, channel_names=["sales"]):
    sys.exit(1)
Usage:
await create_agent_cron(
    path="/sales/respond-to-leads",
    title="Respond to Sales Leads",
    description="Check #sales for new inbound leads and draft responses",
    cron="0 * * * *",  # every hour
    condition_script_path="/work/scripts/conditions/has_new_slack_messages.py",
)
BE AWARE: The example above might run an agent every hour if slack messages are found.
Modifying a Cron
Only use create_agent_cron or create_script_cron if you need to change the cron configuration. Always
read the LEARNINGS.md, execution.log, and scripts/ folder to understand the cron job and its context.
If changing title/description/cron/script:
List cron jobs to find the exact path
Use the appropriate create function with same path (upserts)
Deleting a Cron
List cron jobs to confirm exact path
Use delete_cron
