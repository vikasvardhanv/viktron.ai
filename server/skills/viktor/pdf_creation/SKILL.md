description: Create PDF documents from HTML/CSS. Use when creating PDFs, reports, or formatted documents.
For PDF creation from scratch, always use the weasyprint python package and create the pdf from html/css. do not
use reportlab.
After creating the PDF, use fitz (PyMuPDF) to inspect or preview the generated file so you can verify the output
before returning it.
Include thoughtful design elements, visual hierarchy.
Fonts
Option 1: Pre-installed System Fonts
These fonts are pre-installe:
Sans Serif:Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Noto Sans, Liberation Sans, DejaVu Sans, Carlito (Calibri
replacement)
Serif:EB Garamond, Caladea (Cambria replacement), FreeSerif (Times replacement)
Monospace:Fira Code, Noto Mono, Inconsolata, DejaVu Sans Mono
Icons:Font Awesome, Material Design Icons
Option 2: Google Fonts via @import
Google Fonts @import works.
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;700&display=swap');
body { font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; }
If a Google Font fails to load, WeasyPrint falls back to system fonts silently.
Brand Style Reference for reports
If you're creating a PDF report or audit report, we want to use the companies style:
Check if reference_style.md exists. If so, read it and use the design tokens as a starting point.
If it doesn't exist, run:
uv run python skills/pdf_creation/scripts/extract_site_styles.py https://company-website.com/
Note: The style extractor may suggest Google Fonts. Map them to available system fonts above.
Page Breaks
Prevent elements from being cut in half:
• 
• 
21
h1, h2, h3, h4 { break-after: avoid; }
.card, figure, table, tr { break-inside: avoid; }
p { orphans: 3; widows: 3; }
Note: break-inside: avoid only works if the element fits on a single page.
Flexbox Layout
Prevent text overflow in flex rows:
.flex-item {
    flex: 1;
    min-width: 0;      /* Allows shrinking below content size */
    overflow: hidden;
}
Design guidelines:
Limit horizontal density: Max 3-4 cards per row. If content is text-heavy, use fewer columns or stack vertically.
Consider content width: Ensure text has enough room. Wide content (names, descriptions) needs more space
than metrics.
Always add min-width: 0 to flex children — the default auto prevents shrinking and causes overflow.
<frontend_aesthetics>
You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the
"AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.
Focus on:
Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter;
opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.
Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp
accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for
inspiration.
Layout: Use deliberate whitespace and visual hierarchy. Design for standard paper sizes (A4/Letter). Think
about how content flows across pages.
Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use
geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.
Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
Predictable layouts and component patterns
Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character
Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light
and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space
Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!
