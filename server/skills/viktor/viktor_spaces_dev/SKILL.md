What Are Viktor Spaces?
Viktor Spaces are full-stack web applications you can create for users. Each app includes:
A real-time database (Convex) with separate dev and prod environments
User authentication (email/password)
Frontend hosting (Vercel)
Custom subdomain (format: {project}-{id}.viktor.space where {id} is auto-generated). Preview
deployments have a preview- prefix.
Use them when users need a custom tool, dashboard, internal app, or interactive prototype — anything beyond a
simple document or spreadsheet.
Project Location
All Viktor Spaces apps live in /work/viktor-spaces/{project_name}/.
When you call init_app_project, it clones the template into this folder, creates both dev and prod Convex
deployments, and configures Vercel hosting — ready for development.
Before starting to build a new app ask the user a few questions in one message, if the request is underspecified.
Environment Separation
Each app has two isolated Convex databases:
Environment Convex Database Vercel Target Data Persistence
Preview Dev deployment preview ✓ Persistent
Production Prod deployment production ✓ Persistent
Preview deployments use the dev Convex database — data persists between preview deploys, so users don't
need to re-enter test data
Production deployments use the prod Convex database — completely isolated from dev
Before Making Changes
Always read the project README first:
cat /work/viktor-spaces/{project_name}/README.md
The README contains commands, conventions, auth flows, and the Convex cheatsheet.

What the Template Includes
When you create a new app, it comes pre-configured with:
Convex backend — Real-time database, queries, mutations, actions
Email/password auth — Sign up with OTP verification, sign in, password reset
53 shadcn/ui components — Button, Card, Dialog, Form, Table, etc.
Tailwind CSS v4 — With light/dark theme support
Playwright test utilities — createPageHelper() with auto-login test user
Bun — Fast package manager and runtime
Available Tools
Tool Purpose
init_app_project Create a new app with Convex + Vercel
deploy_app Deploy to preview or production
list_apps List all apps you've created
get_app_status Get URLs and deployment status
query_app_database Query data from the Convex database
delete_app_project Delete an app and all its resources
long timeoutsinit_app_project and deploy_app can take 2-3 minutes to complete. Always use a timeout of
at least 180000ms (3 minutes) when calling these tools via bash.
Development Workflow (Important)
For every major task or new app you are creating:
Read README if not already done
Make a todo.md file with all the things you need to do and also the steps in this list after this one.
Implement feature (backend in convex/, frontend in src/)
Write Playwright e2e test using createPageHelper() from scripts/auth. Every feature should get if
possible and e2e test that just tests it, and that can be run in parallel with other tests.
Sync and build: bun run sync:build (pushes Convex functions + builds frontend)
Run e2e tests: bun run test scripts/your-test.ts (starts preview server, runs test, stops server). Fix
things until the app works as expected.
Take screenshots of the app/feature working. One or more screenshots, depending on what you think is
important to show.
Deploy preview: deploy_app(project_name, environment="preview")
Notify user via Slack with:
Screenshot(s) of the new feature
The exact URL from the deploy response (do NOT construct URLs yourself)
Description of what was added or what you think the user should know.
Request for permission to deploy to production (use buttons)

Wait for user approval before deploying to production
Deploy production: deploy_app(project_name, environment="production")
Getting App URLs
deploy_app() returns url - the deployed app's URL
list_apps() returns preview_url and production_url for each app
get_app_status() returns preview_url and production_url
Test User
For Playwright testing, use the pre-configured test user:
Field Value
Email agent@test.local
Password TestAgent123!
Use runTest() for automatic error handling. The page is already logged in as the test user when your test runs:
import { runTest } from "./scripts/auth";
runTest("My Feature Test", async helper => {
  const { page } = helper;
  // ✅ Already authenticated - starts on /
  await helper.goto("/dashboard");
  const hasElement = await page.locator("text=Welcome").isVisible();
  if (!hasElement) {
    throw new Error("Expected Welcome message");
  }
}).catch(() => process.exit(1));
On failure, automatically shows: screenshot, page URL/content, browser console logs, and Convex backend logs.
Querying Data
Use query_app_database to query either environment:
# Query dev database (preview)
await app_tools.query_app_database(
    project_name="my-app",
    function_name="users:list",
    environment="dev"
)
# Query prod database (production)
await app_tools.query_app_database(
    project_name="my-app",
    function_name="users:list",
    environment="prod"
)

Calling Viktor's Tool Gateway from Convex
Your app can call any coworker SDK function directly from Convex actions. This lets your app access AI-powered
searches, image generation, and all other tools available in the SDK.
How It Works
The template includes convex/viktorTools.ts with a callTool() helper. This function can invoke any SDK
tool by passing the tool's role and arguments.
Example: AI Search
The template includes a quickAiSearch action as an example:
import { useAction } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";
function SearchComponent() {
  const search = useAction(api.viktorTools.quickAiSearch);
  const handleSearch = async (query: string) => {
    const result = await search({ query });
    console.log("Search result:", result); // Returns the AI summary directly as a string
  };
}
Adding More Tools
To add a new tool, first test it to see the response shape, then create a typed wrapper in 
convex/viktorTools.ts:
export const generateImage = action({
  args: { prompt: v.string() },
  returns: v.object({ response_text: v.string(), local_path: v.optional(v.string()) }),
  handler: async (_ctx, { prompt }) => {
    const result = await callTool<{ response_text: string; local_path?: string }
>("coworker_text2im", { prompt });
    return { response_text: result.response_text, local_path: result.local_path };
  },
});
The role parameter is the SDK tool's role identifier, and the second argument contains the tool's parameters.
The project_secret is automatically configured during init_app_project and stored as a Convex
environment variable.
Debugging
cd /work/viktor-spaces/{project_name}
bun run logs:fetch    # Backend logs
bun run check         # Lint errors
In tests, use helper.printConsoleLogs() and helper.printDebugInfo() for browser console output.
